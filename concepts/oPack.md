OpenAF comes with a minimalist and simple package manager. The idea is to enable OpenAF to extend it’s functionalities in a modular way.

The basic unit is an oPack (*o-pack*). A simple ZIP file containing the package contents and a special file with the package definition: *.package.yaml* (or *.package.json*)

These oPack files can be hosted in oPack servers to which OpenAF will connect for:

   * Installing a new oPack
   * Updating an existing oPack
   * Searching for provided oPacks

oPack servers can be public or private. OpenAF comes with a pre-defined oPack server but it’s possible to add other public and private oPack servers.

## Using the oPack command

After installing OpenAF an oPack script will be available to access the oPack functionality.

By default, all oPacks are installed under the same directory from where OpenAF is installed.
