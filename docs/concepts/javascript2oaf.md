# Javascript to OpenAF

This article provides a description of the additions (e.g. functions, variables, libraries, etc...) to the standard JavaScript included with OpenAF.

## Basics

Starting with basics, OpenAF runs on Java interpreting/compiling javascript using [Mozilla Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino). Not the version that was included on the JVM a long time ago but current stable version on GitHub. That means it supports [ES5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp) with some features of [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) (see a [compatibility map from Mozilla Rhino](http://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html)).

You can always check documentation here or, using the openaf-console (oafc), executing the "help" command for more details:

````
> help [partial of full word match]
````

Additionally you can use the openaf-console (oafc) auto-complete, _desc_ and _scope_ commands to find out more.

## Basic

### Basic variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| \_\_ | | Shortcut for undefined |
| global   | | Represents all the global variables (e.g. _this_ on the main context). |

### Basic functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| compare | Compares two javascript objects (with deep map search). |
| clone | Clones the provided javascript object to a new instance. | 
| merge | Merges two javascript maps and/or arrays into a new object. |
| inherit | Given an parent and a child object it will copy the parent javascript prototype to the child prototype. |
| load | Given an OpenAF javascript file it will interpret and compile the corresponding code. Will search the current installed oPack paths if not found on the current path. |
| loadLib | Sames as _load_ but keeping track of previously loaded OpenAF javascript files to avoid re-execution. |
| plugin | Loads a Java-based OpenAF plugin that must be on the classpath. If found on current installed oPack paths it will try to dynamically added to the classpath (when using the custom class loader). | 
| require | Loads an OpenAF javascript with declared exports returning a map with the same. |
| exit | Immediatelly exits the current execution with the provided exit code. |
| arrayContains | Tries to determine if an array contains an object. |
| uniqArray | Returns an array with no duplicated entries (with deep map search). |
| splitArray | Returns the best effort of diving the provided array into a specific number of equal parts. |

## Checking types

### One-line type checking

The one-line type checking propose it's to be used for checking arguments of a function and providing default values or exceptions if a value is not provided.

The syntax of usage is:

````javascript
// For values that must be defined
_$([aVariable], [anOptionalDescription]).[combination of check functions].$_(anOptionalExceptionDescription)

// For values that have a default value
aVariable = _$([aVariable], [anOptionalDescription]).[combination of check functions].default(anOptionalExceptionDescription])
````

Examples:

````javascript
function useEvenNumber(aEvenNumber) {
    // Combining check functions
    _$(aEvenNumber, "aEvenNumber")
    .isNumber()
    .check(v => v % 2 == 0, "has to be even")
    .$_();

    [...]
}
````

````javascript
function modifyChild(aChildUUID, aParentUUID) {
    // Check mandatory
    _$(aChildUUID, "aChildUUID").isUUID().$_("a child uuid must be provided");
    
    // Check and assign defaults
    aParentUUID = _$(aParentUUID, "aParentUUID").isUUID().default("ed258253-a8e3-2df1-5d74-b106e8cd7e9a");

    [...]
}
````

For check functions any combination can be used (each function includes also a second argument to provide more text information about the failure of the check):

| Function | Checking propose | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| anyOf    | Determine if the array provided only has values from a pre-provided array of values. | |
| between | Determines if a number is between a minimum and maximum values exclusively. | |

| check   | Uses the provided javascript function to check. | |
| contains | Determines if a string value contains a sub-string. | |
| empty    | Determines if the provided value is empty. | |
| ends     | Determines if the provided string ends with the provided sub-string. | |
| equals   | Determines if the provided string is equals to the provided string. | |
| greater  | Determines if the provided value is bigger than the provided value. | |
| greaterEquals | Determines if the provided value if bigger or equal than the provided value. | | 
| isArray  | Determines if a variable is an array.  | |
| isBoolean | Determines if a variable is a boolean. | |

| isObject | Determines if a variable is a object (e.g. map, array) | | 
| isRegExp | Determines if a variable is a javascript regular expression. | |
| isSchema | Determines if a provided map is according with the provided JSON schema. | |

| isTNumber | Determines if the type of a number provided, independently of it's conversion from number, is a Number. | |
| isUUID | Determines if a variable is an UUID | |
| javaRegexp | Determines if a Java object provided is a Java regular expression. | |
| less | Determines if a provided number is less than a number. | | 
| lessEquals | Determines if a provided number is less or equal than a number. | |
| notContains | Determines if a provided string doesn't contain a sub-string. | |
| notEmpty | Determines if a variable isn't empty. | | 
| notEnds | Determines if a string doesn't end with a sub-string. | |
| notEquals | Determines if the provided string is not equal to a specific string. | | 
| notStarts | Determines if a string doesn't start with a sub-string | |
| oneOf | Determines if the value is one of the array of values provided. | |
| regexp | Given a regular expression tests if the value matches it. | |
| starts | Determines if a string starts with a sub-string. | |  

### Function type checking

For function-based type checking there are a set of functions prefixed with "is". They provide not only javascript type checking but also java object type checking in specific cases:

## oWrap and other included libraries

The following is a list of the OpenAF and external libraries included. Most of the libraries are automatically loaded by OpenAF when required but _ow.load*_ and _load*_ functions can be used to ensure they are loaded. These load functions can be used repeatedly as OpenAF ensures that they are only loaded on the first call. 

Most of the none basic OpenAF functionality is kept in included "ow" (OpenWrap) _wrapper_ libraries:

| Library | Description | To load |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Format | One of the main libraries with all formatting functionality (might include some old format unrelated functions) | ````ow.loadFormat();```` |
| Obj | One of the main libraries with object manipulation functionality | ````ow.loadObj();```` |
| Server | One of the main libraries with server related functionality when OpenAF code is run as a daemon | ````ow.loadServer();```` |
| Ch | One of the main libraries with [OpenAF channel](OpenAF-Channels.md) functionality | ````ow.loadCh();```` |
| Template | One of the main libraries providing templating functionality (HandleBards based) | ````ow.loadTemplate();```` | 
| Sec | Includes all the [OpenAF 'secure buckets'](sBuckets.md) functionality | ````ow.loadSec();```` |
| Net | Includes network related functionality | ````ow.loadNet();```` |
| Metrics | Includes self monitoring and telemetry functionality | ````ow.loadMetrics();```` |
| Test | Includes unitary test helper functionality | ````ow.loadTest();```` | 
| Java | Java integration functionality | ````ow.loadJava();```` |
| Python | Python integration functionality | ````ow.loadPython();```` |
| AI | Includes some basic AI functionality | ````ow.loadAI();```` |
| Dev | Includes functionality that it's still being tested. | ````ow.loadDev();```` |

External javascript based libraries are also included:

| Library | To load | 
|---------|---------|
| Underscore (Lodash) | ````loadUnderscore()```` |
| FuseJS | ````loadFuse()```` |
| JsDiff | ````loadDiff()```` |
| Ajv | ````loadAjv()```` |
